You may get these offsets from the calibration certificate of your units, but you could also assess it easily, by recording the 3 wind components from the anemometer enclosed in a box with still air (zero-wind test).

                <li value="1"><b>Planar fit file available:</b> If you got a satisfying planar fit assessment in a previous run with EddyPro, which applies to the current dataset, you can use the same assessment by providing the path to the file "eddypro_planar_fit_ID.txt". This file, which contains the results of the assessment, was generated by <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName R">EddyPro®</span> in the previous run. This will shorten program execution time and assure full comparability between current and previous results.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Planar fit file not available:</b> Choose this option and provide the following information if you need to calculate (sector-wise) planar fit rotation matrices for your dataset. The planar fit assessment will be completed first, and then the raw data processing and flux computation procedures will automatically be performed.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Start:</b> Starting date of the time period to be used for planar fit assessment. This time period cannot be longer than about 1 month. As a general recommendation, select a time period during which the instrument setup and the canopy height and structure did not undergo major modifications. Results obtained using a given time period (e.g., 2 weeks) can be used for processing a longer time period, in which major modifications did not occur at the site. The higher the <i>Number of wind sectors</i> and the <i>Minimum number of elements per sector</i>, the longer the period should be.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>End:</b> End date of the time period to be used for planar fit assessment. This time period cannot be longer than about 1 month. As a general recommendation, select a time period during which the instrument setup and the canopy height and structure did not undergo major modifications. Results obtained using a given time period (e.g., 2 weeks) can be used for processing a longer time period, in which major modifications did not occur at the site. The higher the <i>Number of wind sectors</i> and the <i>Minimum number of elements per sector</i>, the longer the period should be.</li>
                <li value="5"><b>Minimum number of elements per sector:</b> Enter the minimum number of mean wind vectors (calculated over each flux averaging interval), required to calculate planar fit rotation matrices. A too small number may lead to inaccurate regressions and rotation matrices. A too large number may lead to sectors without planar fit rotation matrices. If for a certain averaging interval, wind is blowing from a sector for which the rotation matrix could not be calculated, the policy selected in <i>If planar fit calculations fail for a sector</i> apply.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Maximum mean vertical wind component:</b> Set a maximum vertical wind component to instruct <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName">EddyPro</span> to ignore flux averaging periods with larger mean vertical wind components, when calculating the rotation matrices. Using elements with too large (unrealistic) vertical wind components would corrupt the assessment of the fitting plane, and of the related rotation matrices.</li>
                <li value="7"><b>Minimum mean horizontal wind component:</b> Set a minimum horizontal wind component to instruct <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName">EddyPro</span> to ignore flux averaging periods with smaller mean horizontal wind components, when calculating the rotation matrices. When the horizontal wind is very small, the attack angle may be affected by large errors, and so would be the vertical wind component, resulting in poor quality data that would degrade the planar fit assessment.</li>
                <li value="8"><b>If planar fit calculations fail for a sector:</b> Select how <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName">EddyPro</span> should behave when encountering data from a wind sector, for which the planar fit rotation matrix could not be calculated for any reason. Either use the rotation matrix for the closest sector (clockwise or counterclockwise), or switch to double-rotations for that sector.</li>

                <li value="2"><b>Linear detrending:</b><a name="kanchor92"></a> Calculates fluctuations as the deviations from a linear trend. The linear trend can be evaluated on a time basis different from the flux averaging interval. Specify this time basis using the <i>time constant</i> entry. For classic linear detrending, with the trend evaluated on the whole flux averaging interval, set time constant = 0, which will be automatically converted into the text “Same as Flux averaging interval”.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Running mean:</b><a name="kanchor93"></a> High-pass, finite impulse response filter. The current mean is determined by the previous <i>N</i> data points, where <i>N</i> depends on the <i>time constant</i>. The smaller the time constant, the more low-frequency content is eliminated from the time series.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Exponential running mean:</b><a name="kanchor94"></a> High-pass, infinite impulse response filter. Similar to the simple running mean, but weighted in such a way that distant samples have an exponentially decreasing weight in the current mean, never reaching zero. The smaller the time constant, the more low-frequency content is eliminated from the time series.</li>
                <li value="5"><b>Time constant:</b><a name="kanchor95"></a> Applies to the linear detrending, running mean, and exponential running mean methods. In general, the higher the time constant, the more low-frequency content is retained in the turbulent fluctuations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For the linear detrending the unit is minutes, while for the running means it is seconds.</p>

                <li value="2"><b>Covariance maximization:</b> Calculates the most likely time lag within a plausible window, based on the covariance maximization procedure.

However, if a maximum of the covariance is not found inside the window (but at one of its extremes), the time lag is set to the <b>Nominal time lag</b> value stored inside the GHG files or in the alternative metadata file.</li>

            <h4 class="pgBrkBefore"><a name="Fast"></a>Fast Fourier Transform<a name="kanchor99"></a></h4>
            <p>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used for the frequency domain analysis (spectra and co-spectra) of the time series data. Configure the following:</p>
            <p><b>Tapering window:</b> Select the shape of the window used to taper the time series before the Fast Fourier Transform. The tapering procedure is a sample-wise multiplication in the time domain between the time series and the window, performed to reduce the discontinuities of the time series at the boundaries and avoid spectral energy overestimation. <a href="References.htm#Kaimal2">Kaimal &amp; Kristensen (1991)</a> suggested the Hamming window. See <a href="Calculating_Spectra_Cospectra_and_Ogives.htm" class="TOCPageNumber MCXref xref xrefTOCPageNumber">Calculating Spectra, Cospectra, and Ogives</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Frequency bins for spectra and cospectra reduction:</b> Select the number of exponentially-spaced frequency bins to reduce spectra and cospectra. All spectral samples falling in a given bin are averaged, so that smoother curves result, greatly reduced in length. In <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName">EddyPro</span> binned spectra are used for in-situ spectral assessments. See .</p>
            <p><b>Use power-of-two samples to speed up FFT:</b> Check this box to instruct <span class="MyVariablesSoftwareName">EddyPro</span> to use a number of samples equal to the power-of-two closest to the currently available samples, for calculating spectra. This option greatly speeds up the FFT procedure and is therefore recommended. See .</p>
